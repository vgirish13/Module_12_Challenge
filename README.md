# Module_12_Challenge

## Overview

The purpose of this module is for students to understand how to use javascript to change how websites can gather and filter through associated data. Also, students will use HTML to access the website to view the corresponding data. 

## Results

Students were able to introduce multiple different filters in order to narrow down the search results. These filters are in the list below. Depending on the parameters of the filtered search detailed results will be presented to the user. 

- Date

- City

- State

- Country

- Shape

- Duration

- Comments

## Summary

## Drawback

- One drawback of this website is that it is not very visually appealing. In order to attract more visitors, maybe developers should add pictures of "sightings" to keep users more engaged. 

## Recommendations

- It would be beneficial to add drop down list to every filter in order to make the website more user friendly. For example, adding a drop down list with all the shapes that UFO's have previously been "reported"

- Another recommendation is to change the color of the filter table button because it is hard to see that it is an actual button.
